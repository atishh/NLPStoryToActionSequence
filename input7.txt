Annie, Martin, Nora and William are children.
They and their parents were camping out.
They would be living in the cabin by the lake.
The children were very excited.
They go to the lake.
They gazed in wonder at the water.
They gazed at the bright blue sky.
They gazed at the trees standing along the lake.
The cabin stood a little distance away.
The cabin sits right in the middle of the trees.
It was made of wood and looked just right.
It looked almost like a part of nature.
Parents started unloading the cars.
