Annie, Martin, Nora and William are children.
They and their parents were camping out.
They would be living in the cabin by the lake.
The children were very excited.
They go to the lake.
They gazed in wonder at the water.
They gazed at the bright blue sky.
They gazed at the trees standing along the lake.
The cabin stood a little distance away.
The cabin sits right in the middle of the trees.
It was made of wood and looked just right.
It looked almost like a part of nature.
Parents started unloading the cars.
The children ran down to the water.
Two mothers shouted "Be careful, children, don't get into the water until we come."
The children replied "We won't".
They stopped at the water's edge.
They saw a swan and her babies swim to the other side of the lake.
They saw a kingfisher dive in.
The kingfisher scoop up a fish.
They saw a deer come to the water.
The deer drink water.
Their parents joined them.
The children went into the water.
They swam happily for a long time.
Now they are hungry and tired.
Their rooms were tiny.
Their beds were very comfortable.
The children slept peacefully through the night.
There is a sound of birds chirping loudly.
They woke up.
They ran to the window to look out.
Birds of all shapes and sizes flew around.
Birds are looking for their breakfast.
The sun was peeping over the trees.
Annie and Martin saw their parents.
Parents walk along the lake side.
The children yelled, "Mummy, daddy, wait, we're coming too".
The children scrambled into their clothes.
The children ran outside.
Nora and William's parents sat in two comfortable chairs outside.
They walked down to the lake with children.
The children were happy during their holiday.
They said to their parents, "We would return next year too, to the cabin by the lake."
